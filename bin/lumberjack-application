=head1 NAME

lumberjack-application  -  run the Lumberjack::Application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code

    lumberjack-application [--port=8898] [--console]

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple wrapper to run the Lumberjack::Application in the
default P6SGI container (HTTP::Server::Tiny) on a specified port.

It provides a minimal facility for receiving the log messages
sent by C<Lumberjack::Dispatcher::Proxy> and serving them up on
a WebSocket application for viewing.

This uses the default configuration for the web layout as provided
by Lumberjack::Application - that is the log receiver is located at
C</log>, the Websocket endpoint is at C</socket> and the main log
page is at C</> : if you require a different configuration then you
may want to assemble the parts yourself.

    }

    my $application = Lumberjack::Application.new(:$port);
